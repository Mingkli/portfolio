## 🍀 About <a name = "about"></a>

Welcome to VibeGrow! Our innovative project combines hardware and software to revolutionize plant care. At its core is a small device attached to the base of a plant, capable of producing vibrations at frequencies used for insect communication. This device is wirelessly operated through a user-friendly web interface.
Beyond pest control, VibeGrow monitors crucial plant health metrics (soil moisture, temperature, and light exposure), allowing users to care for their plants remotely. Our web application also features comprehensive plant and pest search functionality, providing users with easy access to vital gardening information.

## 🌷 Our Features<a name = "our_features"></a> ## 
  - 💫 **Customized Homepage**: Displays all user plants with names and icons for quick identification.
  - 💫 **Health Alert System**: Icons show question marks when plant parameters are abnormal, prompting user action.
  - 💫 **Real-Time Plant Health Monitoring:** Three progress bars (temperature,light exposure, soil moisture) provide at-a-glance health status.
  - 💫 **Detailed Garden Guidance:** Separate search functionalities for plants and pests, offering cultivation tips and pest control advice.
