    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a student from China, and I have entered my second semester of study life at UQ. My major is in Interaction Design, a field that allows me to combine creativity with technical knowledge, and it's an area I am currently passionate about. My love for design stems from the pursuit of beauty and curiosity about technology, which has grown over time. What I am particularly interested in is researching user needs, which lies at the heart of interaction design. </p>

    <h1>2A</h1>
    <p>In our first assignment of the course, the task was to select several databases of interest from a provided list of database links, such as the Queensland Government database, and, based on these, independently design and complete a website poster. My chosen theme is 'Native Plants and Botanical Gardens of Australia,' a field both rich and fascinating, involving biodiversity, ecological conservation, and natural aesthetics. </p>
    <p>To make this website engaging and entertaining, I adopted a unique visual style—pixel art. This style reminds me of retro pixel games which are simple yet immensely charming and can enhance user immersion. I believe that by emulating this style, it's possible to create a website that is both educational and captivating to users.</p>
    <p>During the design process of the poster, I conducted a comprehensive environmental scan, meaning I delved deeply into existing plant-related websites. I closely examined their layout, content organization, user interface, and interactive elements. From these sites, I gleaned many valuable lessons, such as how to display information effectively and how to design a user-friendly interface.</p>
    <p>In my conceptual design, I used an innovative interactive element: using the 'WASD' keys and arrow keys to control a character's movement within the website. This mode of interaction not only increased engagement but also allowed users to explore Australia's native plants and botanical gardens in a novel and interactive way. I believe this design will encourage users to delve deeper into the content, as it provides a gamified learning experience.</p>

    <h1>2B</h1>
    <p>Our team is a diverse group consisting of four members, including myself and another postgraduate student, Kiki, as well as two undergraduates, Andrew and Stefan. Kiki and I are from China, while Andrew and Stefan are local students.</p>
    <p>The reason we work together is that we were all impressed with each other’s posters. Everyone's work demonstrated a high level of completion and a serious academic attitude, with themes that were attractive and creative. Additionally, our professor emphasized diversity in team formation, which included not only academic diversity, that is, the combination of graduate and undergraduate students, but also cultural background diversity. Such requirements are intended to promote exchange and collaboration between different academic backgrounds and cultural perspectives, enriching the team's vision and enhancing problem-solving capabilities. For these reasons, we decided to form a team.</p>
    <p>During this period, we collectively completed the team charter. We discussed and agreed upon regular meeting times, ensuring that every member could participate, whether in face-to-face meetings or virtual ones. We also decided on the communication applications to facilitate daily communication and information sharing among team members. </p>

    <h1>2C</h1>
    <p>At our group's first meeting, we faced a critical decision: choosing a theme and datasets for constructing our website. After a vote, we ultimately decided to adopt the animal theme proposed by Kiki, which is both interesting and educational. In terms of the website’s interactive methods and aesthetic style, we decided to continue with the concept I designed in assessment 2A. We believe this design, influenced by pixel games, provides an engaging visual experience and user interaction, which is considered key in attracting users and increasing website engagement.</p>
    <p>Based on these decisions, we began planning the website’s structure. We identified the key pages needed for the website: an engaging welcome page, a character selection page, an interactive map page displaying different animal habitats, a search page, a journal page documenting various animal, and a quiz page to test users’ knowledge. The design of these pages aimed to provide a comprehensive and interactive user experience while also ensuring the depth and breadth of educational content.</p>
    <p>Building on this, I was responsible for the functional design of all the pages, including the user interaction methods and the logic for transitioning between pages. This was a complex task that required me to deeply consider the user experience and the fluidity of the website. During phase 2C, referring to Nielsen’s ten heuristics, I invested a lot of time and effort into creating low-fidelity prototypes of the website. These prototypes are preliminary sketches of the website’s design, helping our team visualize and test the basic layout and functionalities. In the fifth week of the semester, Kiki and I decided to spend a weekend in a café to complete the details of the low-fidelity design. It was a weekend full of creativity, we worked together, discussing the design elements of the pages, ensuring that every detail reflected our theme and enhanced user experience. After we completed the low-fidelity prototype, we sent the link to the other two teammates for them to carry out subsequent tasks such as creating the storyboard. Through this collaboration, we not only deepened our understanding of the project but also strengthened our cohesion as a team.</p>

    <h1>2D</h1>
    <p>Our results from the 2D phase did not meet my expectations. Even though we had put a lot of effort into the 2C phase, the grading was not ideal, which made us realize the issues within our project. According to the feedback from our mentor, our project lacked in-depth academic research and reflection, which are critical parts of our project. Therefore, we specifically emphasized these two aspects in our plan for the 2D phase, hoping to improve in this assignment.</p>
    <p>In the seventh week, we had a team meeting to distribute the tasks for creating the high-fidelity prototypes, and I was responsible for creating the high-fidelity version of the map page.</p>
    <p>In the ninth week, we met to discuss in detail the tasks for everyone during this stage of the assignment. Since Andrew and Stefan are not IT majors, they don’t know much about programming and coding, hence Kiki and I took on the responsibility of code development. We hoped that with this division of tasks, everyone would be able to perform best in their areas of expertise, and it seemed like a reasonable choice to have them take care of academic research and the creation of the slides.</p>
    <p>However, during the meeting for task distribution, due to one team member's absence because of an exam, we had a communication problem. Our task allocations and requirements were conveyed through another team member, but perhaps due to language and cultural differences, Kiki and my true intentions were not accurately delivered. This led to a serious issue: It was only one day before the deadline when I saw the other members' work, and it was far from what I had expected. By that time, we no longer had enough time to make the necessary changes.</p>
    <p>On the day of the presentation, because we had not rehearsed sufficiently, time management became very challenging. We spent too much time on the early part of introducing the project, so much so that we had no time left to showcase the high-fidelity prototype and the website's features.</p>
    <p>To make matters worse, the day before the presentation, I discovered that the database link we relied on had become invalid. This was a huge blow to our presentation because without the database link, we could not demonstrate the core function of the website - calling the database through the API. Faced with this emergency, I had no choice but to paste some of the database data directly into the code, which was far from an ideal solution, but was the only thing I could think of in the limited time available.</p>

    <h1>2E</h1>
    <p>This group assignment marked the end of our course project, and it was divided into three main tasks: coding, creating a poster and participating in a trade exhibition, followed by writing a report.</p>
    <p>During the website development phase, I was in charge of coding the welcome page, the character selection page, and the journal page, as well as writing the readme file. In this process, I applied the async() function that tutor Neha taught me after the 2D assessment presentation, which is a powerful feature in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations, greatly enhancing the efficiency and readability of the code.</p>
    <p>Our group's principle was for every member to participate in the coding of the website to ensure that everyone could understand the logic of the website's operation and contribute to the project. However, things did not always go as planned. In practice, Andrew and Stefan, for some reasons, were unable to complete their parts of the code before the deadline set by our group. Fortunately, having learned from our experience in 2D, we had set an internal deadline, and we did not repeat the same mistake, which gave us time to rectify these issues. Kiki took over the unfinished code parts, while they shifted to complete the report section that was originally assigned to Kiki.</p>
    <p>In the poster creation for the trade exhibition and the writing of the final report, I was responsible for the tasks of page design and content integration. I used Adobe Illustrator to design the poster. The layout of the report was completed with Adobe InDesign, a professional desktop publishing software suitable for creating complex documents and formatting text. I also took on the task of writing the 'method of processing the given dataset' and 'implementation description' sections of the report, which required me to detail how we processed data and our website's implementation strategy.</p>
    <p>The most gratifying part was that we conducted thorough rehearsals before the trade show. This time we did not repeat the mistakes of the past, and our time management was improved, with each section having ample time for presentation. 	And our presentation was a great success, and I was very happy and satisfied with it. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also taught me the importance of project management, teamwork, and time management. These lessons are a valuable asset for my future academic and professional career.</p>

    <h1>Paper Review</h1>
    <p>This article is a study published in the 2020 issue of the "Children and Youth Services Review ". The research focuses on preschool children aged 3 to 6 years old and explores how they develop creative skills through the use of digital game-based learning (DGBL) applications on devices such as tablets and smartphones. The aim of the study is to identify which components of DGBL effectively enhance the creative skills of young children and to understand the application of creative skills within this learning method.</p>
    <p>The research was conducted in a Montessori preschool in Malaysia, involving seven children between the ages of 3 and 6. By analyzing the children's creative thinking process using the Analyzing Children's Creative Thinking framework (ACCT), the study examined the interrelationship between the components of creative thinking. The results showed that DGBL has a positive impact on fostering students' creative skills, critical thinking, knowledge transfer, digital experience skills, and a positive learning attitude, providing a profound and insightful learning experience. This proves that DGBL is an effective method for improving learning outcomes.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the study reported positive learning outcomes associated with the use of DGBL, including the development of creative thinking and the acquisition of knowledge and digital skills. These outcomes support the integration of DGBL into educational strategies for educators and highlight the potential of digital games to adapt to various educational contents. The study points out that DGBL tools can be designed or selected based on specific educational goals, such as teaching environmental preservation, demonstrating their versatility as teaching tools.</p>
    <p>These findings align with the purpose of our website, indicating that DGBL could be an appropriate method for teaching about endangered and extinct wildlife, promoting immersive learning in children.  And it can cultivate a positive attitude towards learning, which is crucial for sparking children's curiosity and enthusiasm, providing empirical evidence for teachers to apply our website in their animal teaching practices. </p>

    <h1>Course Reflection</h1>
    <p>The core of this course was not so much focused on teaching specific skills in coding or web design, but rather on the understanding of theoretical knowledge and concepts. However, during the actual project implementation phase, I found that I needed to master more technical skills to complete the implementation of the web page. Faced with this challenge, I chose to bridge this gap through self-study. I utilized tutorials on YouTube to gradually learn React, a modern front-end framework. This process was not just about learning the technology but also a significant enhancement of my self-learning and information retrieval abilities.</p>
    <p>Throughout this learning journey, I'm deeply grateful to our workshop and studio tutors, especially Neha. Her assistance went far beyond the course requirements. Although React was not part of the curriculum this semester, she still enthusiastically helped me solve many coding challenges. This support was invaluable to me.</p>
    <p>In terms of design, the emphasis that our course coordinator, Professor Susan, placed on reflection affected my entire learning process. She consistently stressed the importance of continuous reflection during the design and development process. This mindset was incredibly beneficial to me, as I began to understand that reflection is crucial in every iteration of product development. It helped me identify problems, improve the design, and enhance the quality of the final product.</p>
    <p>I also gained many valuable experiences in teamwork. This is my first time to collaborate with team members from different cultural backgrounds on this coding project. This experience made me recognize the importance of clear communication, and I learned how to express my needs to my teammates intuitively. I also understood why the coordinstor emphasize the importance of diversity in team members, as it brings different perspectives and methods to problem-solving.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I learned the importance of clearly assigning tasks and setting deadlines in teamwork. This not only helps maintain project progress but also ensures that everyone completes their part within the allotted time. I also learned to assign tasks based on each person's strengths rather than distributing them indiscriminately, which maximizes the team's overall efficiency and results.</p>
    <P>Finally, I learned the importance of strictly following the grading rubric with each assignment completion. This means understanding the requirements of the assignment and rigorously adhering to each criterion, treating it as the sole standard for scoring. This approach not only improved the quality of my work but also made me more objective and focused when assessing my own work. Through this course, I have not only improved my technical skills but, more importantly, I have learned how to collaborate effectively in a diverse team, educate myself, and continuously reflect and progress in practice.</P>
