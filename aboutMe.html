            <h2>Something about me</h2>
            <p>In our first assignment of the course, the task was to select several databases of interest from a provided list of database links, such as the Queensland Government database, and, based on these, independently design and complete a website poster. My chosen theme is 'Native Plants and Botanical Gardens of Australia,' a field both rich and fascinating, involving biodiversity, ecological conservation, and natural aesthetics. </p>
            <p>To make this website engaging and entertaining, I adopted a unique visual style—pixel art. This style reminds me of retro pixel games which are simple yet immensely charming and can enhance user immersion. I believe that by emulating this style, it's possible to create a website that is both educational and captivating to users.</p>
            <p>During the design process of the poster, I conducted a comprehensive environmental scan, meaning I delved deeply into existing plant-related websites. I closely examined their layout, content organization, user interface, and interactive elements. From these sites, I gleaned many valuable lessons, such as how to display information effectively and how to design a user-friendly interface.</p>
            <p>In my conceptual design, I used an innovative interactive element: using the 'WASD' keys and arrow keys to control a character's movement within the website. This mode of interaction not only increased engagement but also allowed users to explore Australia's native plants and botanical gardens in a novel and interactive way. I believe this design will encourage users to delve deeper into the content, as it provides a gamified learning experience.</p>

            <h2>My Education background</h2>
            <p>Our team is a diverse group consisting of four members, including myself and another postgraduate student, Kiki, as well as two undergraduates, Andrew and Stefan. Kiki and I are from China, while Andrew and Stefan are local students.</p>
            <p>The reason we work together is that we were all impressed with each other’s posters. Everyone's work demonstrated a high level of completion and a serious academic attitude, with themes that were attractive and creative. Additionally, our professor emphasized diversity in team formation, which included not only academic diversity, that is, the combination of graduate and undergraduate students, but also cultural background diversity. Such requirements are intended to promote exchange and collaboration between different academic backgrounds and cultural perspectives, enriching the team's vision and enhancing problem-solving capabilities. For these reasons, we decided to form a team.</p>
            <p>During this period, we collectively completed the team charter. We discussed and agreed upon regular meeting times, ensuring that every member could participate, whether in face-to-face meetings or virtual ones. We also decided on the communication applications to facilitate daily communication and information sharing among team members. </p>
